## Known Issues

- The jumps are implemented poorly and seem quite dodgey on tablet-size devices.
- The GIF support in Android is not as advanced iOS - so some animation transitions look faded. That said, I haven't tested the game on a physical Android device.
- The font I chose seems a bit hard to read on iOS - the letter spacing seems a bit off.
